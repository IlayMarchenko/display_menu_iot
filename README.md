# Display menu :page_with_curl:

**Hello everyone! This is my own project with TI Launchpad CC1352R1 and BOOSTXL-SHARP128.**

## The main idea  ✨

1. **To create the interactive interface for launchpad.**
2. **To gain knowledge how to work with images on display BOOSTXL-SHARP128.**

## Description

**When you turn on the launchpad, you will see a menu with 4 subparagraphs (“1”, “2”, “3”, “4”). You could choose one and see a big representation of the number on the screen.**

## Navigation 

Movement | Action 
------------ | ------------- 
Up |  One click on the left button
Down | One click on the right button
Choose subparagraphs | Double click on the right button
Exit from subparagraphs | Double click on the left button

## How to run

**To run and flash this project you could use Code Composer Studio. Note that you need to install SDK to work with the Launchpad.**
